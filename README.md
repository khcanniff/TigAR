# Image Recognition: Vuforia
# GPS Guidence: Mapbox
##### We orignally planned on created a script to handle the GPS detection. We created the script GPS.cs. When we tested the script in real world settings we found the GPS to be inaccurate and issues with the objects appearing. The issues with the objects appearing is that the objects overlayed on the scren but not in relation to the path. If the user moved their phone, then the object would move with them. 
##### we investigated google's GPS API but we ran into a roadblock. The roadblock was that we did not have a credit card to enter into the webpage. Looking into other options we found Mapbox.
