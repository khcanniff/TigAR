# Workflow Guide for the Project
This guide is here to instruct or refresh a team member on the typical workflow of the team. We try to follow the Scrum style of management. 
## Communication
The team conducts daily standup meetings MWF in the general channel in [Discord](https://discordapp.com/channels/548010621212557313/548010621644439564). Please remeber to @everyone when you send out your daily standup. Don't worry about posting standups on the Weekend or Holidays.  For short hand notation we use:
```
1) = what I have done
2) = what I'm going to work on
3) = Impediments or possible impediments
```
for example:
```
@everyone 1) I have completed issue #12. 2) start on issue #13. 3) need agreement from John Smith on issue #11 in order to finish issue #13. 
```
